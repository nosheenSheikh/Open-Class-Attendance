# Open-Class-Attendance
Description:
The solution uses facial recognition as the basis of a control system for marking attendance. 
The teacher will generate the bar code and students will scan that bar code.
The application will compare the face of those students face only who have scannedthe bar code instead of comparing each face with all the faces stored in the database.
This would reduce complexity.
