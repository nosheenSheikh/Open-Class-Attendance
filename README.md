# Open-Class-Attendance
Description:
The solution uses facial recognition as the basis of a control system for marking attendance. 
The teacher will scan the bar code and a new class will be created.
Teacher will feed all the class details.
A code will get generated.
A notification will be sent to all students of that class.
On student interface student will join that class.
The student will either join that class or can send request for leave.The approval of leave will depend upen HOD/Sub Teacher. 
After joining student will enter the code and then student can either Join or decline.
The students joining and decliniong the class will have a seperate log.
The application will compare the face of those students face only who have joined the class instead of comparing each face with all the faces stored in the database.
This would reduce complexity.
